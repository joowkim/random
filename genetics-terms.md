Locus (pl. loci):  A fixed position on a chromosome that may be occupied by one or more genes. 

Locus: the location of a gene or other DNA sequence on a chromosome - refers to any/all alleles of that gene.

Allele: One of a number of alternative forms of the same gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome.

Allele: a basic unit to describe a variant form of a given gene

Allele: a non-identical version of a gene or, more generally, of a DNA sequence. One of the versions of a gene or a version of a DNA sequence, even if it's not a gene.

Genotype: The DNA sequence  of the genetic makeup of an organism which determines a specific phenotype of that organism

Genotype: genetic material of an organismallele: a basic unit to describe a variation from a given gene

Genotype is an overloaded term that can mean one of two things:

 - Most commonly within the area of computational genomics, the term genotype refers to the particular alleles found a given position or locus within the genome. So, for instance, if position 7 on the theoretical chromosome in the figure below contains an A on one copy and a G on the other copy. This is said to be a genotype call of A/G at position 7.

 - Less commonly within the area of computational genomics, the term genotype will be used to reference an organism's complete set of genetic material, including all of the variants included therein.
Which definition is implied is largely based on the context of the conversation: if one is talking about a system-wide effect that is likely to be caused by the complicated interaction(s) between various parts of the organism's genetic code, then the second definition is more suited. Within computational genomics, we are often concerned with highly focal changes, hence the preference of the first definition above.

Haplotype:

Recall that each human genome is composed of pairs of chromosomes, one inherited from each parent. That means, with a few exceptions, nearly every gene has two copies. Often the two DNA sequences of that encoded gene differ. Each distinct copy is a haplotype for that gene. Together the two haplotypes make up the genotype, and the proteins they produce determines the phenotype. A variant is often detected on only one copy of the gene. If the variant causes a loss of function in an important gene, that one mutation may be insufficient to cause cancer but may create a predisposition to cancer later in life.


Homology: Similarity due to shared ancestry.
 - Possible causes of similairy
  - Change
  - Independent selection for the same function (convergent evolution)
  - Common ancetry (homology)


Dominance 

Consider two alleles that give different phenotypes when homozygous. If a heterozygours individual has the same phenotype as one of the homozygotes, geneticists say that allele is 'dominant' to the other. Dominance describes a *relationship* beteen two alleles. not a property of a single allele. 

If the heterozygote has an in-­‐between phenotype, We say the allele's effects are **blended** or **addtive** in the heterozygote phenotype (avoid 'semi‐dominance' or 'incomplete dominance')

If the heterozygote has both phenotypes, We say that both allele's phenotypes are seen in the heterozygote (avoid 'co-dominance')

BRCA1 +/-: one functional allele/one defective allele.

Heritability

The degree to which differences in phenotype are due to differences in genotype
