Lysed Cells

• Outer membrane is ruptured 

  – cytoplasmic RNAs leak out
  
  – Loss of mature RNA, increase in pre-mRNA

    • Higher proportion mapping to introns
    • Loss of 3’ sequencing bias
  – Increase in nuclear RNAs
  
    • MALAT1 is an easy marker to use
  – Increase in Membrane associated transcripts
  
    • MS4A family
    • IL7R
    • Complement C3

10x V2 chemistry: 50,000 reads per cell

10x V3 chemistry: 20,000 reads per cell

10x cell viablity is important - above 90%
